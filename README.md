MachineLearning and DataMining
================================

Implements of Machine Learning and Data Mining Algorithm Experimentations


##Branch-and-Bound

A C Implements version of Branch-and-Bound. 

And can be used to analysize the data, generating a logic expression which accepts all the opsitive examples and reject all the negative examples.

##WeatherAnalysis

Processing Weather Data with DM methods

With the fast development of the monitor technology and equipment on Weather-Site, we can get a lot of data. Many important and useful information is hiding behind these data. I try to analysize these weather data to help preview weather it is going to rain or not.

For detail, here we use principal component analysis decision tree(C4.5) and some asso-ciation rules analysis methods to acheive it.

I chose Matlab to do the pretreatment. And using WEKA to do the mining.
